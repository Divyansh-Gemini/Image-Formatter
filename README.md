This project addresses the repetitive and time-consuming task of manually modifying images. When developing websites, there's often a need to
standardize image properties like dimensions and file extensions to follow uniformity in the website. Manually modifying a large number of images is a tedious & time-consuming task.

## Description

Wrote a Python script that modifies images in bulk. The script asks user to select a folder and modifies all the images in the directory. The script can resize images, and change the file format. The script uses the Pillow library to modify images.
